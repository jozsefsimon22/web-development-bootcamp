            <h3>Software Engineering Bootcamp</h3>
            <p>The University of Edinburgh</p>
            <p>July 2022 - January 2023</p>
            <p>I completed a Software Engineering bootcamp at The University of Edinburgh, where I achieved a grade of
                100% and ranked 1st out of 63 students. The program covered advanced topics in software development such
                as database design, and programming languages Python and Java. I learned how to write code that can
                interact with databases, solve real-world problems, and use established design patterns and algorithms.
                I also gained advanced skills in testing, debugging, deploying, and maintaining software systems, while
                ensuring their quality. Throughout the bootcamp, I was guided on how to think beyond mere software
                development and deployment and how to manage a software development project using agile development and
                communicate effectively with technical and non-technical stakeholders. I also learned how software forms
                part of a systemâ€™s architecture, and how to apply best practice principles during the software
                development lifecycle.
